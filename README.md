# **Liber Luminis & Liber Umbrae**

**No dance moves. No “above your grade” gatekeeping.**  
Just a coherent symbolic framework that answers the hard questions without leaving dangling mysteries and mental gymnastics.

## The Straight-Talk Summary 

### Prerequisites (yes, really)
These books are written with the assumption that you have some idea what the fuck is going on already. You don't have to have a fancy title, but you should have *at least* read Magick in Theory and Practice, The Book of the Law, and The Vision and the Voice. It's OK if you don't understand it all, but your eyeballs should have at least read the words. 

Likewise, you should have made up your mind that this is work you value and wish to pursue. 

You need not change your name on Facebook to *"Frater Frazzlepants"* but you should be in some way connected to the occult community either by formal membership or online resources (*I* am **not** your online resource!).

### General Remarks
These books contain absolutely zero dance moves, no hokey-pokey ("put your right ankh in, take your left wand out") kind of shit. 

These books address the hard questions that you've been asking about and keep getting deflected with bullshit like, *"It's above your degree/grade/whatever."* That's just code for *"I have no fuckin' idea."* 

Well, I do have an idea and I want to share it with you. 

Ultimately, you can decide whether you like my ideas or not. They're generally in line with the respected innovators in this subject area. But where I diverge, it's done for very sound reasons. In the end, what you get by going along with what I'm saying is better than any "secret" anyone can bestow upon you. 

I offer: ***Internal consistency.***

If you decide to buy into what I'm saying and model things the way I lay them out, everything fits together. 

No unsightly dangly bits.\
No mental gymnastics to make things fit (Aethyrs, anyone?). 

If you go with the model described in these books, not only will you end up with a coherent system that works (my own life is evidence of that), you'll have a symbolic framework so coherent that you can draw it on a piece of paper!\
(**no, it's not the Tree of Life**)

## What You’re Getting

- A coherent framework you can actually diagram.
- Examples of how to model concepts you already know within the system as you build it.
- Difficult questions addressed head-on with no hand-waving and no bullshit.
- An open-ended system that you can continue to expand upon with new ideas forever.
- Comedic relief + a piss-poor attitude so it doesn’t sound anything like Crowley!

## **Liber Luminis**

Covers many of the less-discussed questions initiates often have early in their journey.\
Describes exactly what you need to do to become an Adept and exactly how to do it (assuming that you have a copy of *Abramelin* already...)\
No time wasted rehashing what a hundred other authors have already said.

Instead: You get a specific perspective and analysis that places familiar concepts into the framework while the framework itself is being built.

## **Liber Umbrae**

This is where we examine the difficult questions using the framework built in *Liber Luminis* to make sense of it all.\
This is also where the autobiographical subplot shows up in full force.

This offers you not just plenty of opportunities to laugh at me, but it also offers a sense of real-world grounding for these concepts.

## FAQ

"If you want to share these ideas so badly, why don't you share them for free?"

I did. Most of the content of both books is available on my Facebook wall if you want to scroll back far enough to find it all. 

But here's the crazy thing about people: If you give them something for free, they don't value it. Paradoxically, charging for the content is the only way to get people to actually read it!
